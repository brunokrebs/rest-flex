## RestFlex - A Backend Focused on Rapid Development

This is a backend server, powered by Node.js and Koa, that focuses on rapid development. By rapid development I mean
that with very little effort, developers should be able to start focusing on the features that really matter to them.

I'm rewriting a software that I started writing on ES6, so right now, there is nothing to look here. Sorry to disappoint,
but I will have a functional prototype in the next weeks.
